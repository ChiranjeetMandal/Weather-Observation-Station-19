Hackerrank problem of sql

Consider p1(a,c)  and p2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points p1 and p2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

NOTE
Euclidean Distance:
The Pythagorean Theorem can be used to calculate the distance between two points, as shown in the figure below. If the points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are in 2-dimensional space, then the Euclidean distance between them is √(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2
